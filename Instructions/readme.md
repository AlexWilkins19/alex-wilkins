# Updating Local Repository

Before making any local changes, ensure that your local repository is in sync with the remote one. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your local Hugo project directory.

2. Ensure that you are on the main branch (or the branch you want to update):

git checkout main


Replace `main` with the name of the branch you want to update if it's different.

3. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository:

git pull origin main


Replace `main` with the name of the branch you want to update if it's different.

Now your local repo is in sync with the remote one, and you can make your changes, test new features, commit, and push them to GitHub as usual. Just make sure to always pull the latest changes before starting any new work to avoid potential conflicts.
