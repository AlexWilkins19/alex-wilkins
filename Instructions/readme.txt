Yes, you can continue to make local changes and push them to your GitHub repository without any issues. However, before making any changes locally, it's a good practice to pull the latest changes from the remote repository to ensure that your local repo is in sync with the remote one. This helps avoid conflicts when you push your local changes to GitHub.

To pull the latest changes from the remote repository, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your local Hugo project directory.

Ensure that you are on the main branch (or the branch you want to update):

css
Copy code
git checkout main
Replace main with the name of the branch you want to update if it's different.

Pull the latest changes from the remote repository:

css
Copy code
git pull origin main
Replace main with the name of the branch you want to update if it's different.

Now your local repo is in sync with the remote one, and you can make your changes, test new features, commit, and push them to GitHub as usual. Just make sure to always pull the latest changes before starting any new work to avoid potential conflicts.
