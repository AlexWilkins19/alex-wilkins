I am a news reporter at *New Scientist* focused on physics and technology, with particular interests in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and astronomy.

I have reported on the frontiers of [artificial general intelligence](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg26234863-300-how-ai-mathematicians-might-finally-deliver-human-level-reasoning/), [world-first astronomical discoveries](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2381928-meteorite-left-earth-then-landed-back-down-after-round-trip-to-space/) and leading biotechnology research, such as the [quest for human hibernation](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25634080-400-human-hibernation-is-a-real-possibility-this-is-how-it-might-work/). I write a bimonthly column on artificial intelligence, examining the latest AI research trends.

I talk about my reporting regularly on *New Scientist Weekly*, and also interview leading scientists on the podcast [*Intelligence Squared*](https://www.intelligencesquared.com/intelligence-squared-podcast/). I am experienced with live events, hosting events and panels, such as for New Scientist's Emerging Technologies Summit and New Scientist Live. I have a BSc in physics from King's College London and an MSc in digital journalism from Goldsmiths, University of London.

I previously worked at *Metro.co.uk*, where I covered science and technology. You can contact me at Alex.Wilkins@newscientist.com.
