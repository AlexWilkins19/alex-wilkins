I've been banging my head on the wall all day, reading Hugo documentation, trying not to get bogged down in the endless, infinite jargon of the modern web.

I've made a little progress, and that's something. This is what I know so far -

I built my website using Hugo, a static site generator that uses the Go programming language to compile fast, static websites. Just getting my head around the file
architecture took so much reading. After that, I had to learn how to use Git, because the code for my website is hosted on a Github repository. Netlify, a cloud-based
hosting web app, then takes the code from my Github repo, and compiles it into a fast, static website, and deploys it for me automatically using its CDN and DNS servers.
